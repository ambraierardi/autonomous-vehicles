# First lab of Autonomous Vehicles  
In this assignment the measurements of an Intelligent Road-Side Unit (*IRSU*) were exploited to compute the position of an autonomous vehicle (*perception*). Later on, other data coming from other IRSUs and vehicles have been used in order to enhance the accuracy.  
The BEV (*Bird-Eye-View*) has also been implemented to convert point clouds and look at them from a top-view perspective and study the different outcomes.  
As last task, it was required to segment and classify the different objects detected in the street: cars, trucks and pedestrians.
